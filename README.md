# üèéÔ∏èF1 Race Position Predictor

What happens when machine learning meets motorsport? This project explores that intersection‚Äîpredicting the final race positions of Formula 1 drivers using real-world race data, and a sprinkle of predictive modeling magic.

##  Project Purpose

The core aim of this project was to build a machine learning pipeline capable of predicting the **finishing position** of each driver during a Grand Prix. Rather than rely on team standings or fan biases, the model analyzes **in-race performance data** to forecast final positions with surprising accuracy.

With F1 being a sport where strategy, milliseconds, and weather shifts make all the difference, this project tries to capture those nuances using data-driven techniques.

##  Data Source

All data was collected using the **[FastF1 API](https://pypi.org/project/fastf1/)**, a Python package that provides access to official F1 telemetry, timing, and race control data. Specifically, this model was trained using detailed telemetry from the **2023 Italian Grand Prix (Monza)**.

##  Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Äì data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` ‚Äì model training and evaluation
- `matplotlib` ‚Äì visualizations
- `joblib` ‚Äì model serialization

##  Features Used

The model leverages the following race-related features:

- `TotalLaps`
- `AvgLapTime`
- `NumPitStops`
- `AvgPitDuration`
- `SafetyCarLaps`
- `PitStopEfficiency`
- `LapTimeEfficiency`
- `WeatherCondition`

These were selected to reflect both race strategy and performance metrics.

##  The Model

- **Model Type**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Target Variable**: `RacePosition` (1 = 1st place)
- **Evaluation Metric**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

###  Result
Final MAE on the test set: **~4.92 positions**  
This means the model can generally predict a driver‚Äôs finishing position within ~5 spots of their actual result‚Äîa decent level of accuracy considering the unpredictable nature of F1 racing.

##  Visual Insights

Two key visualizations help interpret the model's performance:

- **[Predicted vs Actual Race Positions](./visuals/position_barchart.png)** ‚Äì A bar chart comparing model predictions to the real finishing positions.
- **[Feature Importance](./visuals/feature_importance.png)** ‚Äì Highlights which features had the biggest influence on the model's predictions.

You can also explore the raw output in CSV format:

- **[Predicted vs Actual Data (CSV)](./outputs/predicted_vs_actual.csv)** ‚Äì Tabular results showing each driver‚Äôs actual and predicted finishing positions.


##  What I Learned
