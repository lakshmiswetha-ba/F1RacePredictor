# üèéÔ∏è F1 Race Predictor - Predicting the Top 3 Finishers with Machine Learning

This project aims to **predict the top 3 podium finishers** in Formula 1 races using machine learning and historical race data from the [FastF1 API](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/). 

It includes:
- Data collection from F1 sessions
- Feature engineering from lap and race metrics
- Training models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluating predictions and visualizing outcomes



## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the Top 3 finishers (podium positions) in Formula 1 races using real-time and historical data from the FastF1 API. It includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using both metrics and visualizations.

---

## Problem Statement

Formula 1 outcomes depend on many variables: driver skill, team performance, qualifying results, tyre strategy, and track conditions.

Can we use machine learning to accurately predict the top 3 finishers in a race using structured race data?

---

## Data Description & Preparation

The data used in this project is sourced from the **[FastF1 API](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/)**, which provides detailed telemetry and timing data for every Formula 1 session.

## Data Includes:
- Driver name, team, car number
- Lap times, sector times
- Qualifying position
- Pit stops and stint data
- Weather and track status
- Final race position

## Preprocessing Steps:
- Loaded qualifying and race data for each selected Grand Prix
- Removed drivers who did not complete the race or had incomplete lap data
- Converted lap times and speeds into numerical features
- Merged session data into a combined dataset per race

## Engineered Features:
- `position_gain`: difference between starting and finishing position
- `avg_lap_time`: average lap time for each driver
- `pit_stop_count`: number of pit stops
- `qualifying_position`: grid start position
- `laps_completed`: number of laps completed
- `stint_length`: average stint duration between pit stops

## Approach

- **Data Extraction** from FastF1 API  
- **Feature Engineering**: qualifying position, tyre compound, constructor points, average lap times  
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Evaluation**: accuracy score, podium hit rate, confusion matrix  
- **Visualization**: feature importance and predicted vs actual podium comparison  

---

## Key Results

- **Random Forest** achieved approximately **65% accuracy** in predicting podium finishes  
- **Top features** influencing predictions:
  - **Qualifying Position**
  - **Constructor Points**
  - **Tyre Strategy**
- Visualizations helped highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the model  

---

## Feature Importance

To understand the model‚Äôs behavior, we analyzed feature importance scores using Random Forest.  

- Qualifying Position had the most impact ‚Äî better grid positions often lead to better race finishes.  
- Constructor Points indicate team performance and reliability.  
- Tyre Strategy affects race pace and consistency.  

These findings align with real-world F1 race logic.
