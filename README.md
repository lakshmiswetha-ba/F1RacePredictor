# üèéÔ∏è Predicting Formula 1 Podium Finishers using Machine Learning


Project Motivation

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how much strategy and data go into a Formula 1 race. It‚Äôs not just about speed ‚Äî it‚Äôs about timing, precision, and decisions made in milliseconds. As a F1 üèéÔ∏è fan, I wanted to see if machine learning could make sense of all that complexity.

This project is a way to explore how data can tell the story of a race ‚Äî and maybe even predict the outcome before the lights go out.

Project Summary

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict the Top 3 finishers (podium positions) in Formula 1 races using real-time and historical data from the FastF1 API. It features data extraction, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest, XGBoost), and performance evaluation through visual and quantitative methods.

Problem Statement

Formula 1 outcomes are influenced by multiple variables: driver skill, team strength, qualifying results, tyre strategy, and track conditions. The question is:

Can we use machine learning to accurately predict the top 3 finishers in a race using structured race data?

Approach

Data Extraction via FastF1 API

Feature Engineering: qualifying position, tyre compound, constructor stats, lap time averages

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluation: accuracy, podium hit rate, visual validation

Visualization: predicted vs actual podium, feature importance

Key Results

Random Forest achieved ~65% accuracy in predicting podium finishes

Most influential features:

Qualifying Position

Constructor Points

Tyre Strategy

Visual comparisons helped validate model strengths and failure cases

Feature Importance

To understand how the model makes predictions, we analyzed feature importance scores from the Random Forest model:

Qualifying Position had the highest impact ‚Äî better grid starts significantly correlate with podium finishes.

Constructor Points reflect overall team reliability and performance.

Tyre Strategy influenced pace and consistency throughout the race.

These results align with domain knowledge and improve model interpretability.



Predicted vs Actual Podium



üìÉ This comparison illustrates how closely model predictions match real race results. It helps identify races where predictions were accurate and where they diverged.
