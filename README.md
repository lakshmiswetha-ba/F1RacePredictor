# üèéÔ∏è Predicting Formula 1 Podium Finishers using Machine Learning


## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning system that predicts the **Top 3 finishers (podium positions)** in Formula 1 Grand Prix races. By analyzing a combination of **historical and real-time data** ‚Äî including driver statistics, lap times, tyre strategy, qualifying positions, and team performance ‚Äî the model aims to deliver accurate race forecasts that can benefit **fans, analysts, and fantasy league participants**.

Through comprehensive data engineering and machine learning techniques, this project highlights the key factors that contribute to race outcomes and offers an interactive prediction tool.

## Data Collection & Exploratory Data Analysis

Collected and processed data using the **FastF1 API**, which provides real-time telemetry, lap-by-lap data, race metadata, and driver information. The following datasets were used:

- Race metadata (driver, constructor, grid position, track)
- Qualifying and lap time data
- Tyre compounds and stint information
- Pit stop timings
- Weather and circuit conditions (where available)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed to:
- Understand how starting position affects podium finishes
- Analyze tyre strategy vs. lap time consistency
- Compare driver and constructor performance across circuits
- Identify features with high predictive power

This initial analysis guided the feature engineering and model selection processes.

## Machine Learning Models

Trained and evaluated multiple classification models to identify the most accurate predictors for podium finishes. Models explored include:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

These models were selected based on their classification strength, interpretability, and proven performance in structured data problems.

## Application of Machine Learning Models

Each model was trained to predict whether a driver would **finish in the Top 3**. I engineered key features such as:

- Grid position, qualifying performance
- Average lap time in practice sessions
- Pit stop efficiency and tyre strategy
- Historical driver-track performance

Applied **k-fold cross-validation** and **grid search** to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model robustness.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
